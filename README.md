## 55+ C/C++ practice programs.

## Content Structure

- **Program Categorization**: Organized 43 C programs and 12 C++ programs into 8 topical categories (Mathematical Algorithms, Trigonometric Functions, Pattern Printing, Arrays, Control Flow, Recursion, Utilities, OOP etc)
- **Learning Path**: Progressive skill development from fundamentals (variables, loops) to advanced topics (recursion, classes, pointers)
- **Contribution Guide**: Standards for code style, testing, and PR process

## Key Sections

- Repository structure with visual tree
- Featured program descriptions (GCD algorithms, Fibonacci, OOP Circle class, Quadratic solver)
- Learning objectives mapped to concrete code examples
- External resources for C/C++ documentation

## Notes

- Preserved actual filenames including typos (`Calulator.c`, `Finding GCD(Euclidian Algorithm).c`) with clarifying annotations
- Corrected file extension references (`.C` vs `.c`) to match repository
- Added abbreviation explanations (`btn` = between)
